# My Observations and takeaways on the 5GC Build Project : [Link]()

- The First folder inside this project, builds the python files and jar files so we can run it using either python or Java.
	- It is easy to build with maven installed.
	- Its used to test or basically to do HTTP requests with the core PC. I havent tried all the test codes yet, but it should be similar to the other project, which is [5GC_API_Requester]().

- The second Folder, which is Examples. In this 5GC Build project has two folder Python_Client and Python_Server.
